## Directions
Run the project by running `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`.  The database being used is MongoDB hosted in the cloud by mLab.  The event listeners in `main.js` contain promises that reload the webpage, and hide the console logged data.  To view the console logged data, comment out the `window.location.reload()` statement.  This will require a refresh to update the data, but will allow the console logs to be viewed.
